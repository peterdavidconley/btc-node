## BTC Node Project

Create a web application with a dashboard to review bitcoin node statistics. A bitcoin node is the small server that holds either a partial copy or the entire copy of the bitcoin ledger. Nodes are distinct from mining machines, they do not contribute any processing power to the network. As of right now, there are tens of thousands of nodes plugged into the bitcoin network.

Visit [Bitcoinnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io/) for reference.

## Motivation

This project is meant to be a portfolio piece to familiarize yourself with the bitcoin network, specifically bitcoin node data.

## Design Specs

Here is a link to a design mockup: [Design Link]()

## Tech/framework used

React

## Project Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## API Reference

#### Front End Deployment

## How to Use

1. Create the components with the design from the design link above.
2. Make the proper API calls to pull in the bitcoin node data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
